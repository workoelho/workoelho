# Totally Acurate Exchange

The game streamlines many aspects of a real stock market to make it more accessible for the player (and for the developers 😅). There are fewer financial instruments, fictional stocks, and a simplified order excution process and price calculation.

## Development

The game is broken down into:

1. [Client (front-end)](./client), and;
2. [API (back-end)](./api).

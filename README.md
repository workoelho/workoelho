## About

- Bespoke web application in TypeScript.

## Development

Copy environment file from example:

```sh
cp example.env .env
```

Start the application.

```sh
env $(cat .env | xargs) npm start
```

The `start` script will:

- Install dependencies, if needed.
- Start application in "watch mode", if `NODE_ENV` is set to `development`.

## Debugging

Start the server with `--inspect-brk` flag:

```shell
npm start -- --inspect-brk
```

Start the debugger on VSCode.
